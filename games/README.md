# About

This is the source of the [ToBoKi](http://toboki.com) web site.

ToBoKi was created in South Korea in 1960, and is now accessible in English for the first time.

ToBoKi is pure-hearted, intelligent, and sometimes lazy, but that's the just <i>creative</i> aspect of his nature. These characters were created for children, but even adults can love them.

Like curious children of all ages, ToBoKi and his friends always come up with creative ideas for going about their daily routines (although sometimes, they're too creative).
